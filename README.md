# TLAP-Exercises
## Description
This repository contains all the practice questions I've completed while reading the book "Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving" by V. Anton Spraul. At the end of each of his chapters, all of which focus on one of what the author believes are core concepts in modern programming, he includes a set of practice quesions to help the reader apply the methods he presents in the chapter. This helps the reader internalize the concepts at hand by having them flesh out each individual idea themselves. By solving these questions, I was able to apply and deepen my knowledge of various programming abstractions, including but not limited to:
- Object Oriented programming 
- Recursion
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Complex data types/data structures (linked lists, different variations of binary trees, hash tables, lists, etc.)
- Algorithms
- Libraries
- Design patterns (builders, iterators, strategy/policy, etc.).

Completing these exercises has been incredibly helpful in my learning journey, not only in terms of learning new programming concepts but also in the fundamental way in which I approach problems in general.
